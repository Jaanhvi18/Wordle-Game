# jWordle: Java Implementation of the Wordle Game

## Overview
In this project, I implemented the backend logic of a Java version of the popular word game, Wordle. The focus was on using procedural programming paradigms and enhancing my Java syntax skills. The graphical user interface (GUI) was provided, and my task was to make the game functional by implementing the game logic.

## Installation and Setup
- Clone the repository
- Ensure Java is installed on your system.
- Compile the Java files: `javac WordleLogic.java WordleView.java`
- Run the program: `java WordleLogic`

## Features
- **Game Logic**: Implementation of the backend logic that processes user inputs and game state.
- **Word Validation**: Checks if the user's guess is a valid English word and provides feedback.
- **GUI Interaction**: Interaction with the provided GUI to reflect game changes.
- **Debug Mode**: A debug mode that aids in the development and testing phases.

## Usage
- Start the game by running `java WordleLogic`.
- Use the GUI to input guesses for the secret word.
- The game provides feedback on each guess through colored tiles.
